# dadsay

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AzMoo/dadsay.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AzMoo/dadsay)

A console application that takes a joke from the great https://icanhazdadjoke.com/ API and
prints it with an ASCII Dad, obviously inspired by the venerable cowsay.

This was a fun little project I used to get more familiar with Rust. Please read the source 
and tell me how terrible it is. I live for your criticism. 

To build it you should be able to just clone the repository and run `cargo build`. Maybe 
I'll set up some proper CI to build some binaries in the future. Maybe I won't. Only 
time will tell.
